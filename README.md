# Prismic-11ty-Netlify Minimalist Boilerplate
 
This is a work-in-progress minimal boilerplate that uses [Prismic CMS](https://prismic.io), [11ty static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev) and is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). It can be deployed and used for free within the free tiers offered by those services.

This boilerplace does not include any build tools for compiling/minifying your SASS/JavaScript, I want to keep it tool-agnostic for now, so you'll need to add these on top yourself.
